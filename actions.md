## Call Command/Event
This action allows you to call another command or event from the command (or event) you're currently running. For example: say you have an event which logs `${member} ran ${tempVars("command")} in ${tempVars("channel")}` to a logging channel, but you do not want to add the actions to every single command. You could create an event with no trigger, and use **Call Command/Event** to call those actions from any command you wish to log.
