----
## Call Command/Event
This action allows you to call another command or event from the command (or event) you're currently running. For example: say you have an event which logs `${member} ran ${tempVars("command")} in ${tempVars("channel")}` to a logging channel, but you do not want to add the actions to every single command. You could create an event with no trigger, and use **Call Command/Event** to call those actions from any command you wish to log.

----
## End Action Sequence
This action has no agruments, and simply stops the bot from running anything else in the current command. This is useful for running commands with multiple options (like a `!help` command) where you want to run specific actions based on what is input by the user.

## Run Script
This action allows you to run your own custom script within the bot. You can enter *almost* any valid JavaScript (including Discord.js) into this action to run from within the bot. This is useful for creating your own custom actions for any missing items you wish to use.
