# Frequently Asked Questions

# Running the bot
## Can I run two bots at the same time? 

Sort of. You cannot run two bots in DBM at the same time, but you can run a second instance of your bot via command prompt. [Click Here](https://silversunset.net/dbm/tutorials#running-your-bot-247-running-your-bot-with-cmd) for instructions.
